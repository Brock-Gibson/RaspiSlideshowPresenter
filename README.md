### About

The project is all powered by multiple raspberry pi's on one network. One acts a host for the web server, while the rest fetch the web page and display it full screen. The host Raspberry Pi runs a simple [Apache Web Server](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md "Set up Raspberry Pi Web Server").

The other Pi's run [Raspian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), and just have a full screen web page loaded on them, with some changes in the config files to prevent the GUI interface from going to a black screen. 

The project was managed with Axosoft at our page [Here](https://nicholasriley.axosoft.com/).
We had three sprints, each running 5 days Monday - Friday. Our scrum planning happened every Monday.
